# Endnotes

This guide covered the common accessibility issues and solutions, yet web content often goes beyond simple or common. This is where your institution's accessibility experts and web developers can help! Never be afraid to ask for help as we all benefit. Go forth and create good!

## Contributors welcome!

This guide is written in Gitbooks with files in Github to allow for easy collaboration. Additional contributors are welcome, either as writers or editors. It would be wonderful to create a series of easy to understand guides on accessibility. Topics could include deeper-dives into topics such as audio-visual accessibility and physical facilities accessibility. Anything that can make our library world more accessible would be welcome.
