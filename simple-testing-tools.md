# Let's install a simple accessibility testing tool

In the next section, we'll outline strategies for creating accessible content. As you create this material, try this simple tool for double checking your work \(and also to examine older content for accessibility upgrades\). 

## Tota11y accessibility visualization tool

\*\*\*\*[**Tota11y**](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/) is a bookmarklet created by the Kahn Academy to help you visualize how your content is perceived by screen readers and other assistive technology. 

### Installation method 1: bookmarklet <a id="Installation"></a>

Do you keep a bookmarks bar visible? Simply click and hold the Tota11y link below, then drag the link from the box below into your bookmarks bar. To activate the tool, simply click the bookmark.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*\*\*\*[**tota11y**](javascript:%28function%28%29{var%20tota11y=document.createElement%28'SCRIPT'%29;tota11y.type='text/javascript';tota11y.src='https://khan.github.io/tota11y/tota11y/build/tota11y.min.js';document.getElementsByTagName%28'head'%29[0].appendChild%28tota11y%29;}%29%28%29;)\*\*\*\*
{% endhint %}

### Installation method 2: Chrome extension

[Tota11y is also available as a Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tota11y-plugin-from-khan/oedofneiplgibimfkccchnimiadcmhpe/related). Install the extension, then click the eyeglasses icon in your toolbar to activate.

We will review these tools on the following pages as we talk about how to create better content.
